ToDo-Backend in Java 8 with Java EE 8
=====================

This implementation of the [Todo-Backend API](https://www.todobackend.com/) is is running on the [Java EE 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/overview/index.html) compatible [Payara Micro](https://www.payara.fish/payara_micro) as a microservice. The Maven deps are quite simple and only the built war is needed to be passed to the imbedded server in the Procfile to run. 

It's live at [https://javaeetodo.herokuapp.com/todo](https://javaeetodo.herokuapp.com/todo).

You can [play with it here.](https://www.todobackend.com/client/?https://javaeetodo.herokuapp.com/todo)

One can also [run the tests](https://www.todobackend.com/specs/index.html?https://javaeetodo.herokuapp.com/todo) to make sure it's compliant with the Todo-Backend specs.
